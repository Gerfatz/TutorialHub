    <h1>How to close a fridge</h1>
    <p>Have you ever felt cold while looking for something to snack on in the fridge? If so, you’ve probably thought that now would be the right time to close that thing. But… how do you do it?
        Before I tell you exactly how to close the door, let me talk about how I got into this exact same scenario. It was a usual warm winter on a lovely December, when I suddenly got a call from uhhh… uhm… I got a call from the uhhhhhhhhhhhhh… The uhm… Sorry, I kinda hit my head pretty bad today so I might be forgetting some things. Oh I remember now, so there was this one uhm what’s it called again? Right, some “thing” (I can’t really remember what it’s called). And yea when I did the… did the uh, thing… I had to uhm… Yea can I get a uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh… Anyways, yea the Emus did their thing and also I like… got to throw a boomerang which was pretty cool. So yeah uhhh, what was this all about anyways? Oh yea right closing fridges. Right so I was in the kitchen once, and that one guy told me to get us both like soft drinks that were in there and stuff. So I opened up the fridge and thought to myself: “I should probably close this once I’m done” So I thought to myself, but more probably out loud actually now that I think of it: “Why don’t I just open it in reverse?” And so yeah…

    <h2>Right so step 1: </h2>
    <p>Grab the handle. (If you had let go of it that is) And then for the next step:</p>
    <h2>Step 2: The closing process.</h2>
    <p>Un-open the fridge. It’s like opening it, but in reverse. You’ll see what I mean, just look at the image below:</p>
