    <h1>How to make a tutorial</h1>
    <p>Making tutorials is one of the most important tasks in our current day and age, as it keeps the tutorial gods from wreaking havoc upon our non-Ibroist mortal plane of existence. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be a lot of tutorials on how to make tutorials (probably, don’t fact check us). Luckily, we’ve got you covered with a tutorial on making tutorials, so that one day, you and the upcoming generations can make more tutorials on making tutorials, therefore preventing the Armageddon prophesied by the great ancient Ibro (he was bald).</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Choosing a text editor</h2>
    <p>In today’s digital age, a lot of options for text editing tools are available online, a lot of them even for free! One of the more popular ones you might be familiar with being Microsoft Word. One shouldn’t forget that the option of writing your tutorials on paper still exists. Do be aware that it can make distribution difficult, as copying it will usually require someone reading the text and typing it out digitally on some text editor. We recommend that you eliminate that middleman and immediately start writing digitally. For this tutorial, we have chosen to use Microsoft Word, because why not? You can’t stop us! You are nothing in comparison to the size of the TutorialHub corporation. Go cry us a river, maybe we’ll be able to see it from our skyscrapers in NY City. Then, and only then, might we give a [CENSORED]</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Making the title and the text introduction</h2>
    <p>In Microsoft Word, under the “Start” menu, you can find a list of premade text formats, which you can use to identify between the main title, certain steps, and the instructions. </p>
    <img src="content/images/o_Word_format.png" alt="Formatting bar in Microsoft Word" width="700"/>
    <p>One of these formats is, conveniently, made just for titles. Select the format by clicking on it, and it should immediately apply it on the location of your mouse cursor. Now, you can write the subject of your tutorial. Huh, you don’t have a subject? Why are you looking up how to make tutorials when you don’t even know what you want to make a tutorial about? Never mind, just come up with some random subject so that we can continue this tutorial.
        …
        …
        You can’t come up with anything? Has every drop of creativity completely dried out in your brain??? Alright fine, well make so -actually… How about we show you how to come up with subjects? It could still pass as part of making a tutorial, since the subject is, well, kind of important…
        </p>
        <h2>Step 3: Harvesting creativity</h2>
        <p>For you to successfully come up with a subject, you need to have at least 5ng of Creativium in your veins. Substances like these are quite difficult to obtain on the mortal plane… but that won’t stop us. Nothing can stop us. There are no exceptions.
            You will need a level floor, on which you are to place  1.5m x 1.5m of papers. Now, take 5dl of goat blood and leave it in the sun for exactly 15 minutes. You can also use soy milk if you do not want a goat to get hurt, as those usually contain the blood of the unimaginable that live in the depths below as a secret ingredient. These do not need to be left in the sun.
            Once your liquid of choice is prepared, draw the following pattern on the 1.5m x 1.5m paper surface:

        <p>It should now look something like this:</p>

        <p>Finally, place exactly 1555.38 Rubles on the drawn pattern and chant the following words:</p>

        <h2>Step 6: Repeat</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You have received 0.0007994pg of Creativium. And after using it all up, you have come up with the following tutorial subject: Egg. Amazing! Now repeat the process to come up with more words. Once you have enough, it should look like text (more or less). And boom! Your tutorial is complete. Thank you for reading this tutorial.</p>
